            The Australian Rover Challenge (ARCh) is an annual robotics
            competition held by the University of Adelaide, where university
            students from across Australia and around the globe, battle it out
            in a full-scale Lunar mission, using semi-autonomous rovers that
            they have designed and built themselves. Competitors showcase their
            skills in a custom built simulated lunar environment, and complete a
            range of tasks including navigation, resource, and construction.
            Unlike many other rover competitions across the world which focus on
            Martian exploration, the ARCh is focused specifically on completing
            tasks on a simulated Lunar surface.
